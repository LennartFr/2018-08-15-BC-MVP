   ### Permissioned, permission-less
   ### Tokens and incentive mechanisms
   ### Identity and Zero Knowledge
   ### Consensus mechanisms
   ### On-chain, off-chain
   ### Systems integration
   ### Inter-ledgering
   ### Physical-digital with IOT

   ## Who writes to the Blockchain?
   Who reads from the Blockchain?
   
   ## How many ORGS, Peers, etc.
   
# Step 4: Chain Code
